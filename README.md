# Replicability
- to reproduce the code you must obtain the data by downloading the data folder or googing to the website and obtaining the 5 year data of weekly averages
- download any necessary libraries that you will use to code, my code required the statsmodel.api library (pip insatll statsmodels)
- then import the data to a dataframe.
- clean the data for improved readability
- then you can do your own analysis
